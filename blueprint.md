# On-Demand Delivery App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and structure for building a minimum viable product (MVP) of an on-demand delivery application. The app will be built using Flutter and will leverage Firebase for backend services and Google Maps for location-based features.

## Features

The MVP will include the following screens:

*   **Login Screen:** A simple login screen to authenticate users.
*   **Home Screen:** The main screen of the app, where users can request a delivery.
*   **Tracking Screen:** A screen to track the status of an ongoing delivery.

## Project Structure

The project will be organized as follows:

```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── router.dart
└── screens/
    ├── home_screen.dart
    ├── login_screen.dart
    └── tracking_screen.dart
```
