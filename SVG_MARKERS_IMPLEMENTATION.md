# SVG VEHICLE MARKERS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS  
**Enhancement:** Replace Circle Markers with SVG Vehicle Icons  

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

Based on your React Mapbox example, we'll implement custom SVG vehicle markers using:

1. **Point Annotations with Images** - Load SVG assets as custom marker images
2. **Asset Loading** - Convert SVG files to image data for Mapbox
3. **Dynamic Marker Creation** - Create vehicle-specific markers based on driver's vehicle type
4. **Pulsing Background** - Keep subtle pulsing circles behind SVG markers for visibility

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Step 1: Asset Image Loading**
- Load SVG assets as byte data
- Create image markers for each vehicle type
- Register images with Mapbox style

### **Step 2: Custom Marker Creation** 
- Replace circle-based markers with SVG point annotations
- Maintain pulsing background for visibility
- Dynamic vehicle icon selection based on vehicle type

### **Step 3: Real-time Updates**
- Update SVG marker when driver moves
- Change marker when vehicle type changes
- Maintain performance with efficient marker management

## 📱 EXPECTED RESULT

Instead of colored circles, customers will see actual vehicle icons:
- 🏍️ Motorcycle SVG for motorcycles
- 🚚 Truck SVG for delivery trucks  
- 🚐 Van SVG for vans
- 🚗 Sedan SVG for cars
- And all other vehicle types with their specific icons

This will provide **professional visual identification** exactly like the major delivery platforms!
