The `driver_profiles` table in Supabase has been updated with new fields to support enhanced customer app functionality. These changes are now LIVE in production.

## SCHEMA CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. New Field: `plate_number`
- **Column Name:** `plate_number`
- **Data Type:** `VARCHAR(20)`
- **Purpose:** Store vehicle license plate/registration number
- **Nullable:** Yes (allows NULL for existing records)
- **Index:** Added for performance (`idx_driver_profiles_plate_number`)

### 2. New Field: `profile_picture_url`
- **Column Name:** `profile_picture_url`
- **Data Type:** `TEXT`
- **Purpose:** Store URL to driver profile photo/avatar
- **Nullable:** Yes (allows NULL for existing records)
- **Usage:** For customer app driver identification and trust building

## IMPACT ON DRIVER APP

### REQUIRED ACTIONS FOR DRIVER APP AI:
1. **Update Driver Profile Management:**
   - Add plate number input field in driver registration/profile update forms
   - Add profile picture upload functionality
   - Validate plate number format according to local regulations

2. **API Updates:**
   - Include `plate_number` and `profile_picture_url` in driver profile API responses
   - Update driver registration endpoints to accept these new fields
   - Modify driver profile update endpoints

3. **Data Validation:**
   - Implement plate number format validation
   - Add image upload validation for profile pictures
   - Ensure proper URL validation for profile_picture_url

### CUSTOMER APP INTEGRATION:
- Customer app now displays driver information including:
  - Driver name and photo
  - Vehicle type and model
  - **License plate number** (NEW)
  - Driver ratings
- This enhances customer trust and delivery transparency

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### SQL Schema Update Applied:
```sql
-- Add plate_number field
ALTER TABLE public.driver_profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS plate_number VARCHAR(20);

-- Add profile_picture_url field  
ALTER TABLE public.driver_profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_url TEXT;

-- Add performance index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_driver_profiles_plate_number 
ON public.driver_profiles(plate_number);
```

### Expected Data Format:
```json
{
  "driver_id": "uuid",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "vehicle_type": "Car",
  "vehicle_model": "Toyota Camry",
  "plate_number": "ABC-1234",
  "profile_picture_url": "https://storage.supabase.co/driver-photos/john-doe.jpg",
  "rating": 4.8,
  "total_deliveries": 156,
  "is_verified": true
}
```

## BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
- All existing driver profiles remain functional
- New fields are optional (nullable)
- No breaking changes to existing API endpoints
- Existing driver profiles will have NULL values for new fields until updated
