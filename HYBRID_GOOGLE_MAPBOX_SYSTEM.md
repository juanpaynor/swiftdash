- **Google Place Details API**: Exact business and address details with $17/1000 requests
- **Session Token Optimization**: Reduces billing by grouping related requests
- **Philippines-Focused**: Country restriction, proximity bias to Metro Manila
- **Smart Caching**: 24-hour cache reduces API costs by ~80%

### **2. Hybrid Address Service** (`hybrid_address_service.dart`)

- **Unified Interface**: Single API for both services
- **Service Toggle**: Can switch between Google/Mapbox programmatically
- **Quality Scoring**: Rates address quality 0-100 for delivery suitability

### **3. Enhanced Address Input** (`address_input_field.dart`)

- **Service Indicators**: "via Google Places" or "via Mapbox" badges
- **Smart Icons**: Different icons for businesses, roads, addresses
- **Enhanced Details**: Business names, ratings, address components

### **4. Location Selection Screen** (`location_selection_screen.dart`)

- **Debug Logging**: Detailed console output for address components
- **Premium Button Text**: Different text for high-quality addresses

## **💡 How It Works**

### **Search Flow:**
1. **User types** → Hybrid service tries Google Places first
2. **Google Places** returns superior autocomplete suggestions
3. **User selects** → Google Place Details API gets exact address
4. **Fallback**: If Google fails, automatically uses Mapbox
5. **Display**: Shows service source and quality indicators

### **Address Quality:**
- **Google Places**: 90-100% quality (businesses, exact addresses)
- **Mapbox Enhanced**: 60-85% quality (geocoded addresses)
- **Basic Locations**: 40-60% quality (approximate coordinates)

## **💰 Cost Structure**

### **Per 1,000 Deliveries (Estimated):**
- **Google Autocomplete**: ~2,000 calls = **$5.66**
- **Google Place Details**: ~1,000 calls = **$17.00** 
- **Mapbox Fallback**: ~200 calls = **$0.10**
- **Mapbox Maps/Routing**: Included in existing usage
