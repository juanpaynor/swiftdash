## 🚀 How to Test

```bash
flutter run
```

### Multi-Stop Testing:
1. Set pickup location (green marker)
2. Toggle "Multi-Stop Delivery" ON
3. Click **+ Add Stop** button
4. Select first address → Blue marker "1" appears
5. Click **+ Add Stop** again
6. Select second address → Blue marker "2" appears
7. Watch the **neon cyan route** draw through all stops!
8. Camera auto-fits to show entire route

### Other Tests:
- Click focus button multiple times → Only 1 marker
- Change pickup/delivery → Old routes disappear
- Scroll bottom sheet → Focus button stays top-right
- Check map → Street names and POI visible
