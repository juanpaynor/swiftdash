# Driver Offer Testing - October 9, 2025

## ðŸ§ª **Test the New Offer/Acceptance System**

### **How It Now Works:**

1. **Customer requests delivery** â†’ Status: `'pending'`
2. **System finds driver** â†’ Status: `'driver_offered'` 
3. **Customer sees:** "Driver found! Waiting for acceptance..."
4. **Driver accepts/declines** â†’ Status: `'driver_assigned'` or back to `'pending'`
5. **Customer goes to tracking** only after driver accepts

### **Test Driver Acceptance (Temporary)**

Since your driver app doesn't have accept/decline UI yet, you can manually test acceptance:

**Option 1: Use Supabase SQL Editor**
```sql
-- Accept the delivery (simulate driver accepting)
UPDATE deliveries 
SET status = 'driver_assigned', 
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'driver_offered';

-- Set driver as busy
UPDATE driver_profiles 
SET is_available = false 
WHERE id = (SELECT driver_id FROM deliveries WHERE status = 'driver_assigned' LIMIT 1);
```

**Option 2: Use Supabase REST API**
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://lygzxmhskkqrntnmxtbb.supabase.co/functions/v1/accept_delivery' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "deliveryId": "YOUR_DELIVERY_ID",
    "driverId": "YOUR_DRIVER_ID", 
    "accept": true
  }'
```

### **What You Should See Now:**

1. **Request delivery** in customer app
2. **See "Searching for drivers..."** (normal)
3. **See "Driver found! Waiting for acceptance..."** (NEW!)
4. **Manually accept** using SQL above
5. **Customer app navigates to tracking** (only after acceptance)

### **For Driver App Development:**

Your driver app should:
- **Listen for offers:** `status = 'driver_offered'` where `driver_id = current_driver`
- **Show accept/decline buttons**
- **Call accept_delivery function** with accept: true/false
- **Handle the response**

The infrastructure is now ready for proper driver app integration! ðŸš€

### **Test Steps:**

1. Make sure your driver app is online and available
2. Request a delivery from customer app  
3. You should see the new "waiting for acceptance" message
4. Use the SQL above to simulate acceptance
5. Customer should then go to tracking screen

**The offer/acceptance system is now properly implemented!** âœ…
