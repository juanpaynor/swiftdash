```

**Your enhanced 6-step flow is now fully supported in the database!** 🎉

---

## 📱 **Customer App Updates** ✅ **COMPLETED**

### **Real-time Status Notifications:**
- 🚗 `going_to_pickup` → "Driver is heading to pickup location"
- 📍 `pickup_arrived` → "Driver has arrived at pickup location"
- 📦 `package_collected` → "Package collected - heading your way!"
- 🚚 `going_to_destination` → "Driver is on the way to you"
- 🏁 `at_destination` → "Driver has arrived at your location"
- ✅ `delivered` → "Delivery completed successfully!"

### **Enhanced Progress Timeline:**
The customer tracking screen now shows all 8 steps:
1. Order placed
2. Driver assigned
3. **🆕 Heading to pickup**
4. Driver at pickup
5. Package collected
6. **🆕 On the way to you**
7. **🆕 Driver arrived**
8. Delivered

---

## 🔧 **API Usage for Driver App**

### **Status Update Pattern:**
```dart
// Update delivery status throughout your flow
await supabase.from('deliveries').update({
  'status': 'going_to_pickup', // Use any of the new status values
  'updated_at': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
}).eq('id', deliveryId).eq('driver_id', driverId);
```

### **Enhanced Driver Flow Implementation:**
```dart
// Your 6-step flow implementation:

// 1. Accept Order
await updateDeliveryStatus('driver_assigned');

// 2. Navigate to Pickup (NEW)
await updateDeliveryStatus('going_to_pickup');

// 3. Arrive at Pickup  
await updateDeliveryStatus('pickup_arrived');

// 4. Package Collected
await updateDeliveryStatus('package_collected');

// 5. Navigate to Destination (NEW)
await updateDeliveryStatus('going_to_destination');

// 6. Arrive at Destination (NEW)
await updateDeliveryStatus('at_destination');

// 7. Proof of Delivery
await completeDeliveryWithPOD();
```

### **POD Implementation:**
```dart
// Complete delivery with Proof of Delivery
Future<void> completeDeliveryWithPOD({
  required String deliveryId,
  required File proofPhoto,
  required String recipientName,
  String? deliveryNotes,
}) async {
  // 1. Upload photo to Supabase Storage
  final photoPath = 'delivery-photos/${deliveryId}_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}.jpg';
  await supabase.storage.from('driver-documents').upload(photoPath, proofPhoto);
  final photoUrl = supabase.storage.from('driver-documents').getPublicUrl(photoPath);

  // 2. Complete delivery with POD data
  await supabase.from('deliveries').update({
    'status': 'delivered',
    'proof_photo_url': photoUrl,
    'recipient_name': recipientName,
    'delivery_notes': deliveryNotes,
    'completed_at': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
  }).eq('id', deliveryId);
}
```
