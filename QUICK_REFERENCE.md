flutter run
```

### Quick Tests:
1. Click focus button multiple times → Should only show 1 marker
2. Set pickup & delivery → Route draws → Change location → Old route disappears
3. Scroll bottom sheet → Focus button stays top-right
4. Turn on multi-stop → Click + Add Stop → Modal opens
5. Look at map → Street names and POI visible in dark theme
